# MemeMeV1
Udacity MemeMe Project Version 1

This project was designed to showcase the use of UIKit elements. It was created from the ground-up rather than 
adding to a Udacity Project. The app allows users to take a photo or choose one from their library, and then
add text to create a Meme. The user can then share that Meme.
